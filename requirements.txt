Our project relies on a powerful set of libraries to make text-to-image generation possible:

mediapy: Manipulate images and videos, enabling dynamic content creation.
torch: The PyTorch framework serves as the backbone for our deep learning models.
sys: Essential for system-level operations and interactions.
DiffusionPipeline: Enhances data preprocessing and augmentation.
random: Injects randomness into the generation process, fostering diversity in the output.
